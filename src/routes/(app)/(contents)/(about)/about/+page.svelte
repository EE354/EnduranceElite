				<h3 class="text-primary-500">Our Facility</h3>
				<br />
				<p>Our facility offers 10,000 sq. ft. of gymnastics space, ONE Baby Gym, and TWO Dance studios.</p>
				<br />
				<p>At Endurance Elite we believe that communication is key and that parents should have the ability to hear and see what their child is doing in class. We do not have stuffy lobbies blocking your ability to see and hear behind windows. Our open layout allows for parents and visitors to watch safely from the upstairs mezzanine. You can always see your child!</p>
				<br />
				<p>A separate Baby Gym allows for a safe environment for babies and toddlers to run, play and jump. Our upstairs tv displays both dance studios and the baby gym to provide an easy view to your little one. Both studios are equipped with beautiful Marley floors, surrounding wall mounted bars and beautiful 6' mirrors.</p>
				<br />
				<p>We aren't done! Endurance Elite has so much more to offer. Alongside our gymnastics equipment we have a full Ninja Warrior obstacle course and Aerial Silks. There is literally something to do for everyone in the family.</p>
				<p>The future at Endurance Elite is so BRIGHT! Let's grow together! Our home is your home.</p>
