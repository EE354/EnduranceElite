                <h3>WHY Endurance Elite Dance Classes are different than other dance schools: </h3>
                <p>At Endurance Elite we believe that movement is growth and the joy of learning should be shared with each and every one of our students. Our classes are structured so that all students are engaged in the lesson, meaning there is little to zero time for sitting, waiting in lines or standing around. Our energetic and active dance instructors make it their number one priority to maintain their class' full attention and participation.</p>
                <br><p><span class="font-bold bg-primary-500">Class Structure:</span> Each class participates in an active warm-up and stretch, followed by barre work, dance across the floor, center work and finally a cool down. Preschool classes will also use props such as bean bags, cones, hula hoops, beanie babies, scarves and more. The music played in every class is related to the students age, genre of dance and the exercises or dances being performed.</p>
                <q class="flex justify-center m-4 font-bold">When you dance, your purpose is not to get to a certain spot on the floor, but to enjoy every step along the way.</q>
