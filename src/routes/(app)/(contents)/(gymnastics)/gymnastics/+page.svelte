            GYMNASTICS
        </h1>
        <p>We offer gymnastics to children as soon as they can walk! Every class is divided by age and level. All coaches are trained and certified as USA Gymnastics Professionals and do their very best to make every class enjoyable. Skill cards are distributed to all students at the end of every two months to show their accomplishments as well as to determine their current level and if a change to a higher level must take place.</p>
        <br><p>Please read through all of the class descriptions to decide which class best fits your needs. We make it easy to sign up for classes online from your computer or phone, 24 hours a day, using our Parent Portal. Fill in your information, choose your class and insert payment information. We are looking forward to seeing you in the gym!</p>
